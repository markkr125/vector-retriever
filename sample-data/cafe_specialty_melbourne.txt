Higher Ground occupies a converted power station in Melbourne's CBD, serving exceptional specialty coffee and innovative brunch dishes that have made it an international destination for food enthusiasts. The industrial space features exposed brick, soaring ceilings, and floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the dining room with natural light.

The coffee program sources single-origin beans from sustainable farms across Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala. Baristas compete in national championships and expertly prepare flat whites, cortados, and filter coffees using rotating guest roasters. The house blend balances chocolate and berry notes perfect for milk-based drinks.

The all-day menu focuses on seasonal Australian produce with Middle Eastern and Asian influences. Signature dishes include ricotta hotcakes with honeycomb butter, shakshuka with house-made labneh, and miso mushroom donburi with poached egg. Vegan and gluten-free options comprise nearly half the menu without compromising flavor or creativity.

The bakery produces sourdough bread, laminated pastries, and desserts fresh daily. The banana bread achieves cult status, with customers ordering loaves to take home. Fresh juices, smoothie bowls, and turmeric lattes cater to wellness-focused diners.

The space accommodates both laptop workers with reliable WiFi and social groups around communal tables. The outdoor courtyard provides shaded seating during Melbourne's mild weather, often featuring lush plant installations and art exhibitions.

Service remains efficient despite high volume, with staff knowledgeable about menu ingredients and preparation methods. The venue's popularity means weekend waits can exceed 45 minutes, but weekday mornings offer more immediate seating.

Higher Ground has expanded to Sydney and Jakarta, though Melbourne locals insist the original remains superior. The venue hosts regular cupping sessions, latte art throwdowns, and industry events supporting Melbourne's renowned coffee culture.

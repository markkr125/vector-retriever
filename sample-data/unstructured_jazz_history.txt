Jazz emerged in early 20th century New Orleans from a confluence of African rhythms, European harmonies, and American blues traditions. Enslaved Africans brought polyrhythmic complexity and call-and-response patterns, while European immigrants contributed harmonic frameworks and instrumentation. The resulting synthesis created something entirely new—a music characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and swing feel.

Louis Armstrong revolutionized jazz in the 1920s, shifting focus from collective improvisation to virtuosic solos. His trumpet playing demonstrated unprecedented technical mastery and emotional expression, while his scat singing influenced vocal jazz for generations. Armstrong's innovations established the jazz soloist as storyteller, using melodic invention to create compelling musical narratives.

The swing era of the 1930s-1940s made jazz America's popular music. Big bands led by Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman filled dance halls with propulsive rhythms and sophisticated arrangements. Ellington in particular elevated jazz composition, crafting pieces that showcased individual band members' voices within complex orchestral frameworks. Works like "Mood Indigo" and "Ko-Ko" demonstrated jazz could achieve artistic depth rivaling classical music.

Bebop rebelled against swing's commercial accessibility, prioritizing complexity and virtuosity over danceability. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell played angular melodies over fast tempos and intricate chord progressions. The music demanded serious listening, establishing jazz as art music rather than entertainment. Bebop's harmonic innovations—altered chords, tritone substitutions, modal thinking—expanded the musical vocabulary available to improvisers.

Cool jazz emerged in the 1950s as a mellower alternative to bebop's intensity. Miles Davis's "Birth of the Cool" recordings featured arranged passages, softer tones, and more relaxed tempos. The West Coast scene embraced these aesthetics, though critics sometimes accused the music of sacrificing emotional depth for intellectual sophistication.

Hard bop incorporated gospel and R&B influences, reconnecting jazz with African American musical roots that bebop had deemphasized. Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Horace Silver's quintets exemplified the style's bluesy, soulful approach. The music maintained bebop's harmonic complexity while prioritizing groove and emotional directness.

Modal jazz, pioneered by Miles Davis's "Kind of Blue," simplified harmonic structures to focus improvisers' attention on melodic development. Using scales (modes) rather than chord progressions as improvisational frameworks freed soloists from navigating rapid harmonic changes. John Coltrane's "Giant Steps" and subsequent explorations pushed harmonic density to extremes before his own modal period produced spiritual masterworks like "A Love Supreme."

Free jazz abolished conventional structure entirely. Ornette Coleman's "The Shape of Jazz to Come" dispensed with predetermined chord changes and steady tempos. Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp extended the approach, using raw, vocalized tones and collective improvisation to express political and spiritual urgency during the Civil Rights era.

Fusion combined jazz with rock, funk, and world music. Miles Davis's "Bitches Brew" employed electric instruments, rock rhythms, and studio techniques inspired by psychedelic rock. Weather Report, Return to Forever, and Herbie Hancock's Headhunters explored electronic textures and funk grooves. Critics debated whether fusion maintained jazz's essential qualities or represented commercial compromise.

Contemporary jazz encompasses diverse approaches—from Wynton Marsalis's neo-traditionalism to Kamasi Washington's spiritual jazz revival, from Brad Mehldau's introspective piano trios to Esperanza Spalding's genre-blending compositions. The music continues evolving, incorporating hip-hop, electronic production, and global influences while maintaining improvisation and swing as defining characteristics.

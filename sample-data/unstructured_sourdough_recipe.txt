Homemade sourdough bread requires patience, practice, and understanding of fermentation science. The process begins with creating a starter—a living culture of wild yeast and lactobacilli bacteria captured from flour and the environment. Feeding the starter with fresh flour and water daily maintains microbial balance, developing the tangy flavor characteristic of sourdough.

The ideal starter exhibits predictable doubling within 4-8 hours after feeding, produces a pleasant sour aroma, and shows bubbles throughout indicating active fermentation. Consistency matters more than exact hydration percentages, though most bakers maintain 100% hydration (equal weights flour and water) for easier calculations.

Bread dough typically contains just four ingredients: flour, water, salt, and starter. Mixing hydrates flour proteins, enabling gluten development through kneading or extended fermentation. Higher hydration doughs (75-80%) produce more open crumb structures with irregular holes, while stiffer doughs yield tighter, more uniform crumb.

Bulk fermentation, the first rise, typically spans 4-6 hours at room temperature, though cold fermentation in the refrigerator for 12-48 hours develops more complex flavors. Stretch-and-fold techniques every 30 minutes during early bulk fermentation strengthen gluten networks without intensive kneading.

Shaping transforms loose dough into structured loaves that hold their form during final proofing and baking. Creating surface tension by dragging dough across the counter develops skin that supports vertical rise in the oven. Most recipes call for either round boules or oblong batards, though creative bakers shape everything from baguettes to braided challah.

Final proofing in banneton baskets (or bowls lined with floured cloth) typically takes 2-4 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. The poke test determines readiness: properly proofed dough springs back slowly when gently pressed, leaving a slight indentation.

Baking in preheated Dutch ovens or covered vessels traps steam, preventing crust formation during the first 20 minutes. This enables maximum oven spring—the dramatic expansion as gases expand and yeast produces a final burst of CO2 before dying at 140°F. Removing the lid for the final 20-30 minutes develops deep caramelized crusts through Maillard reactions.

Scoring the dough surface with a sharp blade immediately before baking controls expansion direction and creates distinctive patterns. Traditional French baguette scoring features diagonal slashes, while boules often showcase single crosses or decorative designs. Proper scoring depth (about 1/4 inch) prevents tearing during oven spring.

Cooling completely before slicing allows the crumb structure to set and starches to crystallize, preventing gummy texture. Fresh bread tastes best within 24 hours, though sourdough's acidity provides natural preservation, keeping loaves fresh for 3-5 days when properly stored in paper or cloth bags that allow moisture to escape.

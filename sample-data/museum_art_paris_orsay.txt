The Musée d'Orsay houses the world's finest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces within a stunning Beaux-Arts railway station on the Left Bank. The museum's holdings span 1848-1914, bridging the Louvre's classical collection and the Pompidou's modern art.

Highlights include Monet's water lilies series, Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette, Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhône, and Degas' ballet dancer sculptures. The upper gallery features works by Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec that revolutionized Western art.

The building itself represents architectural artistry with its iron and glass barrel-vaulted ceiling, grand clock faces, and Belle Époque ornamentation. The fifth-floor café overlooks the Seine through the station's original clock, offering arguably Paris's most photogenic museum dining experience.

Audio guides in 12 languages provide context about artistic movements, historical context, and individual artist biographies. Dedicated family tours engage children with interactive activities, scavenger hunts, and art-making workshops. School groups receive discounted admission and customized educational programs aligned with curriculum standards.

Temporary exhibitions rotate quarterly, recently featuring retrospectives on female Impressionists, photography's influence on painting, and Art Nouveau design. Evening openings on Thursdays extend hours until 9:45 PM with reduced crowds for more intimate viewing.

Accessibility features include wheelchair access throughout, elevators to all floors, tactile tours for visually impaired visitors, and ASL-interpreted tours twice monthly. The museum shop offers high-quality reproductions, art books, and unique gifts designed by contemporary artists.

Advance booking is essential during peak season to avoid multi-hour queues. Combined tickets with the Orangerie Museum provide access to Monet's monumental Water Lilies panoramas. The Paris Museum Pass includes unlimited visits for 2, 4, or 6 consecutive days across 60+ venues.

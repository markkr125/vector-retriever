Restaurant Étoile brings three-Michelin-star molecular gastronomy to Singapore's Marina Bay district. Chef Antoine Beaumont trained under Ferran Adrià at El Bulli and helms this 24-seat intimate dining theater where science meets culinary artistry.

The 18-course tasting menu evolves monthly, featuring liquid nitrogen ice creams, edible flowers suspended in transparent broths, and deconstructed classics reimagined through molecular techniques. Recent highlights include foie gras cotton candy, oyster foam with seaweed caviar, and wagyu beef cooked at precisely 52.5°C for 72 hours.

The wine pairing includes 12 rare vintages selected from a 10,000-bottle cellar spanning Burgundy Grand Crus to natural wines from emerging regions. The sake pairing alternative features exclusive batches from small Japanese breweries unavailable elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

Reservations open three months in advance and typically fill within hours. The restaurant accommodates dietary restrictions with advance notice, creating entirely separate tasting menus for vegetarian, vegan, or allergen-free requirements without compromising innovation or presentation.

The minimalist interior features live kitchen views where diners watch the 15-person brigade execute techniques like spherification, gelification, and emulsification. Each course arrives with detailed explanations of ingredients, sourcing, and preparation methods.

The experience includes welcome champagne in the private lounge, post-dinner mignardises, and gift-boxed house-made chocolates to take home. Photography is encouraged but flash is prohibited to maintain ambiance for all guests.

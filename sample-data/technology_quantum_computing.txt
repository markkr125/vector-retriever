Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to solve problems intractable for classical computers. Recent advances have produced systems with over 100 qubits, demonstrating quantum advantage for specific optimization and simulation tasks.

Applications span drug discovery, where quantum computers model molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, to cryptography, where they threaten current encryption methods while enabling quantum-secure communications. Financial institutions explore quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization and risk analysis.

Challenges remain in error correction and maintaining quantum coherence at practical operating conditions. Companies and research institutions worldwide race to achieve fault-tolerant quantum systems. Hybrid approaches combining classical and quantum processing show promise for near-term practical applications.

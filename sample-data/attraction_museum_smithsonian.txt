The Smithsonian National Museum of American History houses an incredible collection spanning centuries of American culture, innovation, and democracy. From the original Star-Spangled Banner to Dorothy's ruby slippers, the museum preserves iconic artifacts that tell the nation's story.

Permanent exhibitions explore themes including democracy, innovation, culture, and military history. Interactive displays engage visitors of all ages, with hands-on activities for children and thought-provoking multimedia presentations for adults. Special exhibitions rotate throughout the year, featuring topics from First Ladies' fashion to the history of American food.

Admission is completely free, though timed-entry passes are recommended during peak seasons to avoid long lines. The museum café offers American classics, and the gift shop sells unique educational toys, books, and memorabilia. Audio guides available in multiple languages enhance the visitor experience.

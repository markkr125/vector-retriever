Quantum computing is an emerging field that uses quantum mechanics principles 
to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), 
quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states 
simultaneously through superposition.

The potential applications of quantum computing include:
- Cryptography and security
- Drug discovery and molecular modeling  
- Financial modeling and optimization
- Weather forecasting and climate modeling
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning

Major tech companies and research institutions are investing heavily in 
quantum computing research and development.

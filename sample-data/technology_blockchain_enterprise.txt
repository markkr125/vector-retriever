Blockchain technology has evolved beyond cryptocurrency into enterprise solutions for supply chain management, digital identity verification, and smart contracts. Distributed ledger systems provide transparency and immutability, reducing fraud and improving traceability across complex business networks.

Major corporations implement private and consortium blockchains for use cases including provenance tracking in food safety, pharmaceutical authentication, and international trade documentation. Smart contracts automate agreement execution, reducing intermediaries and settlement times from days to seconds.

Challenges include scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainty. Layer-2 solutions and alternative consensus mechanisms address performance limitations. Interoperability protocols enable different blockchain networks to communicate, expanding potential applications across industries.

Yosemite National Park showcases some of America's most breathtaking natural wonders, from towering granite cliffs to thundering waterfalls and ancient giant sequoias. The park offers over 800 miles of trails ranging from easy valley floor walks to challenging backcountry expeditions.

Half Dome and El Capitan attract rock climbers from around the world, while casual hikers enjoy the paved paths to Bridalveil Fall and Mirror Lake. Spring brings the most spectacular waterfall displays as snowmelt swells Yosemite Falls to maximum flow. Wildlife viewing opportunities include black bears, mule deer, and numerous bird species.

Park entry permits are required and should be reserved in advance during peak season. Campgrounds fill quickly, though comfortable lodging options exist in Yosemite Valley. Rangers lead free guided walks and evening programs sharing the park's natural and cultural history. Photographers will find endless inspiration at every turn, particularly during golden hour.
